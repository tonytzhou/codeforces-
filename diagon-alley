/*Before going to school, the first-years will prepare for everything they need for Hogwarts. Usually, they get everything from Diagon Alley - a cobblestoned wizarding alley and shopping area located in London, England behind a pub called the Leaky Cauldron.

The Diagon Alley
Harry is looking at the list of items he needs - there are n
 of items on his shopping list, and the price of the i
-th item is pi
 Galleons (the wizard's currency). Unfortunately, he only has k
 Galleons with him. Now he wants to know, in that case, how many items he can buy at most. For each item, Harry only needs at most one of them.

Input
The first line of the input contains two integers, k
, which is the total amount of money Harry has, and n
, which is the number of items on Harry's shopping list.

The next line contains n
 integers. The i
-th integer is the price of the i
-th item on Harry's shopping list.

Output
The output only contains one integer, which is the number of items Harry can buy at most.
