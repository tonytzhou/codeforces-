# Documenting my Competetive Progamming Journey
After having a class in school that focused a lot on solving some coding problems to learn how to implements different data structures, I wanted to dabble in competetive progamming in order to improve my skills. By creating and managing this repository, I hope to track my progress while also being familiar with github. I hope to see improvements in not just my code, competetiveness and rank, but also gaining valuable skills and intution that is necessary as a CS major.
